## Historical marine biodiversity literature

In this repo are the some analysis and queries to quantify the historical 
marine literature about biodiversity which hasn't been curated but is 
digitised.

The goal is to provide a rough estimate of the work ahead towards the 
marine biodiversity document rescue.

Currently, the road to rescue data is far ahead from digitisation which
still is the first crutial step. Three subsequent but equally hard tasks
remain. The transcription of the text in these documents, the 
recognition of the containing entities and their mapping to standardised
identifiers. 

Lastly, the publication of these data to public repositories, like OBIS 
and GBIF, is the last step for their rescue and their synthesis with 
current data.
